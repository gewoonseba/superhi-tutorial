        <h3>Lost and found</h3>
        <p>
          "Lost and Found" is a compelling project featured in my portfolio that
          delves into the theme of rediscovery amidst chaos. Through a series of
          multimedia installations, the project juxtaposes items and memories
          presumed lost with their unexpected reappearances, exploring the
          emotional resonance of finding what was once thought to be gone
          forever. This work aims to evoke a sense of nostalgia and reflection,
          encouraging viewers to contemplate the transient nature of loss and
          the joy of unexpected recoveries.

          of the familiar. It delves into the multifaceted nature of individual
          personas, revealing hidden layers and unexpected facets that prompt a
          deeper inquiry into how we perceive ourselves and others. This project

        <h3>Far Away</h3>
        <p>
          Exploring themes of distance and longing, "Far Away" is a poignant
          project that delves into the emotional landscapes of separation and
          connection. This work uses a blend of photography and narrative to
          convey the sense of yearning and hope that accompanies being far from
          loved ones or familiar places. Through its evocative imagery and
          heartfelt stories, the project captures the delicate balance between
          the sorrow of being apart and the beauty of cherished memories and
          anticipated reunions. "Far Away" invites viewers to reflect on their
          own experiences of distance and the powerful bonds that endure despite
          it.

          adversity. This project combines striking visuals with raw, emotive
