        <h1>Aria Oslo is a digital artist based in Portland, Oregon.</h1>
        <p>
          She focuses on juxtaposing portraiture with geometric abstraction, a
          nod to her first career as an architectural technician working on
          shaping cityscapes. Aria graduated from Oregon State University in
          2012 with an art history degree, where she discovered her love for the
          Orphism art movement - her graduate project was a 3d puzzle and art
          piece titled Moving On. After deciding to go back to her art roots,
          Aria launched her 3d puzzle on Kickstarter in 2017 and left her day
          job. She now produces digital artwork for advertising, commissions and
          sells prints on her online shop, Orpheum. When Aria is not creating
          art, she's exploring the Pacific Northwest, reading mystery novels,
          and hosting board game nights. She can also be found mulling over all
          kinds of puzzle pieces, contemplating how it all fits together and how
          art imitates life (or is it the other way around?).
